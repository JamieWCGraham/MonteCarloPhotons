# MonteCarloStar
This is a repository dedicated to Lab10 of PHY407- Computational Physics Labs at U of T


 This is a code that performs a Monte Carlo simulation in order to compute 
 the angular distribution of photons emitted from the core of a star 
 all the way to the photosphere, as well as the angular dependency of the 
 specific intensity. Input consists of various max optical depths,
 T_max = 10 and T_max = 0.0001, and output consists of histograms of the photon
 distribution for various angles, as well as plots illustrating the angular 
 dependency of the specific intensity for both T_max inputs.
